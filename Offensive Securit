#Securely delete files 
#All free space on hard drive:
cipher /w:C:
#Free space in a specific folder
cipher /w:C:\Users\Kenny\Documents
#NOTE: Cipher is slow, a large drive could take several hours, even a single folder can take more than a half hour.
#NOTE: After/while running Cipher, sometimes a temporary folder call "EFSTMPWP" (Extensible File System Temporary Files
Working Placeholder). Cipher should remove the temporary files in that folder when finished, but if not, it can be deleted.
